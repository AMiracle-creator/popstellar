# Social Media

Provides twitter-like social media functionality that allows roll call
participants to "chirp", react to chirps and follow each other.

## Dependencies

**Note**: This feature has not been separated from the other features yet and
thus the exact dependencies are a bit unclear. Running `npm run depcruise`
suggests that it depends on the `rollCall`, `lao` and `wallet` features.
